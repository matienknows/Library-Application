# Library-Application

Background: I have developed this application during my time as exchange student in Istanbul

This Application defines a library system where users can search for books.
Furthermore, it is possible to do a reservation for a certain book or remove the reservation. 

Administrator can controll the whole system and look for some statistical data about popular books,
total amount of reserved and borrowed books.

TECHNICAL PART:

I developed a mssql database and adjust it as backend. 
I realized the frontend with Visual Basic.
